    <h1>Id and classes tutorial</h1>
    <div Id="mainbox" class="redbg blackborder">
        <!-- We make Id when we wanna specify some uniq elements or tag & wanna do something special in CSS, class can be multiple or multiple elements can have same class -->
        This is mainbox
        <!-- We may add many more classes by just adding a space between classes, 1 element may have multiple classes but only can have one Id in one element -->
        <!-- Turn to learn Emmet -->
    </div>
    <span class="redbg"></span>
    <span id="mainbox"></span>
    <!-- . is for class shortcut & # is for id in CSS-->
    <div class="redbg blackborder anotherClass"></div>
    <!-- so now learnt that Emmit takes div tag as a default means that if you'll write .blackground then it'll create a class for uh, like given below-->
    <div class="blackBackground"></div>
    <!-- creating multiple elements with Emmit -->
    <!-- span.you1.you2.you3 +<tab>   -->
    <!-- to print 4 similar elements using Emmit like below element*4 and clicked on enter -->
    <span class="you1 you2 you3">1st</span>
    <div> <span class="you1 you2 you3">2nd</span>
    </div>
    <div><span class="you1 you2 you3">3rd</span>
    </div><span class="you1 you2 you3">4th</span>
    <!-- id is a identifier which means that identify this Id & give it to a particular element & do not give the same Id to another element -->
