    <h2>three ways to add CSS to the Markup</h2>
    <p>Inline CSS:-CSS is added to the elements directly using style attribute</p>
    <!-- inline CSS add CSS in one line only, wrtie css in .css file in a saperate line-->
    <p>Internal CSS:-CSS is kept inside the head tags in <style></style> tags </p>
            <!-- include that css file to markup or we can apply css in head tag so we can apply css in all tag that are already in head -->
            <p>External CSS:-CSS is kept separately inside a.css style sheet
        <style></style> tags </p>
        <!-- if the css file is too long & we need to apply it in html markup so create a separate css file & then include or add it in html markup -->
